> Fit Gamma-Poisson Generalized Linear Models Reliably.

The core design aims of `gmlGamPoi` are:

* Fit the Gamma-Poisson models on arbitrarily large or small datasets
* Be faster than alternative methods, such as `DESeq2` or `edgeR`
* Calculate exact or approximate results based on user preference
* Support in memory or on-disk data
* Follow established conventions around tools for RNA-seq analysis
* Present a simple user-interface
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies
* Make integration into other tools easy
