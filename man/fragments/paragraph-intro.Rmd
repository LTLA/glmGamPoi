> Fit Small and Large Scale Gamma-Poisson Generalized Linear Models.

_Gamma-Poisson is just another name for the Negative Binomial model. It however better emphasizes the overdispersed count nature of this model._

The `glmGamPoi` R package provides an easy to use interface to fit Gamma-Poisson models efficiently. It is designed to handle large scale datasets with thousands of rows and columns as they are typically encountered in modern high-throughput biology. It can automatically determine the appropriate size factors to normalize for different sizes across samples and infer the overdispersion for each row in the input matrix. The package can handle in-memory datasets, but also on-disk matrices with the `DelayedArray` package.
