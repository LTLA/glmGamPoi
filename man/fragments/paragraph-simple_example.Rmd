To fit a single Gamma-Poisson GLM do:

```{r}
# overdispersion = 1/size
counts <- rnbinom(n = 10, mu = 5, size = 1/0.7)
# size_factors = FALSE, because only a single GLM is fitted
fit <- glmGamPoi::glm_gp(counts, design = ~ 1, size_factors = FALSE)
fit

# Internally fit is just a list:
c(fit)
```

The `glm_gp()` function returns a list with the results of the fit. Most importantly, it contains the estimates for the coefficients Î² and the overdispersion.
