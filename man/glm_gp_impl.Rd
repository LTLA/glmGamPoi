\usage{
glm_gp_impl(Y, model_matrix, offset = 0, size_factors = TRUE,
  overdispersion = TRUE, do_cox_reid_adjustment = TRUE,
  n_subsamples = min(1000, ncol(Y)), verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{any matrix-like object (e.g. \code{matrix()}, \code{DelayedArray()}, \code{HDF5Matrix()}) with
one column per sample and row per gene.}

\item{model_matrix}{a numeric matrix that specifies the experimental
design. It can be produced using \code{stats::model.matrix()}.
Default: \code{matrix(1, nrow = length(y), ncol = 1)}, which is the
model matrix for a 'just-intercept-model'.}

\item{offset}{Constant offset in the model in addition to \code{log(size_factors)}. It can
either be a single number, a vector of length \code{ncol(data)} or a matrix with the
same dimensions as \code{dim(data)}. Note that if data is a \code{DelayedArray} or \code{HDF5Matrix},
\code{offset} must be as well. Default: \code{0}.}

\item{size_factors}{in large scale experiments, each sample is typically of different size
(for example different sequencing depths). A size factor is an internal mechanism of GLMs to
correct for this effect.\cr
\code{size_factors} can either be a single boolean that indicates if the size factor for each sample should be
calculated. Or it is a numeric vector that specifies the size factor for each sample. Note that
\code{size_factors = 1} and \code{size_factors = FALSE} are equivalent. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{overdispersion}{the simplest count model is the Poisson model. However, the Poisson model
assumes that \eqn{variance = mean}. For many applications this is too rigid and the Gamma-Poisson
allows a more flexible mean-variance relation (\eqn{variance = mean + mean^2 * overdispersion}). \cr
\code{overdispersion} can either be a single boolean that indicates if an overdispersion is estimated
for each gene. Or it can be a numeric vector of length \code{nrow(data)}. Note that \code{overdispersion = 0} and
\code{overdispersion = FALSE} are equivalent and both reduce the Gamma-Poisson to the classical Poisson
model. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{do_cox_reid_adjustment}{the classical maximum likelihood estimator of the \code{overdisperion} is biased
towards small values. McCarthy \emph{et al.} (2012) showed that it is preferable to optimize the Cox-Reid
adjusted profile likelihood.\cr
\code{do_cox_reid_adjustment} can be either be \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} to indicate if the adjustment is
added during the optimization of the \code{overdispersion} parameter. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{n_subsamples}{the estimation of the overdispersion is the most cumbersome step when fitting
a Gamma-Poisson GLM. For datasets with many samples, the estimation can be considerably sped up
without loosing much precision by fitting the overdispersion only on a random subset of the samples.
Default: \code{min(1000, ncol(data))} which means that by default at most 1000 samples are considered
for each gene to estimate the overdispersion.}

\item{verbose}{a boolean that indicates if information about the individual steps are printed
while fitting the GLM. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
