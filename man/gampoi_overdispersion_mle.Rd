\title{Estimate a Single Overdispersion for a Vector of Counts}
\usage{
gampoi_overdispersion_mle(y, mean_vector = mean(y),
  model_matrix = matrix(1, nrow = length(y), ncol = 1),
  do_cox_reid_adjustment = TRUE, n_subsamples = min(1000, length(y)),
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a numeric or integer vector with the counts for which
the overdispersion is estimated}

\item{mean_vector}{a numeric vector of either length 1 or \code{length(y)}
with the predicted value for that sample. Default: \code{mean(y)}.}

\item{model_matrix}{a numeric matrix that specifies the experimental
design. It can be produced using \code{stats::model.matrix()}.
Default: \code{matrix(1, nrow = length(y), ncol = 1)}, which is the
model matrix for a 'just-intercept-model'.}

\item{do_cox_reid_adjustment}{the classical maximum likelihood estimator of the \code{overdisperion} is biased
towards small values. McCarthy \emph{et al.} (2012) showed that it is preferable to optimize the Cox-Reid
adjusted profile likelihood.\cr
\code{do_cox_reid_adjustment} can be either be \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} to indicate if the adjustment is
added during the optimization of the \code{overdispersion} parameter. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{n_subsamples}{the estimation of the overdispersion is the most cumbersome step when fitting
a Gamma-Poisson GLM. For datasets with many samples, the estimation can be considerably sped up
without loosing much precision by fitting the overdispersion only on a random subset of the samples.
Default: \code{min(1000, ncol(data))} which means that by default at most 1000 samples are considered
for each gene to estimate the overdispersion.}

\item{verbose}{a boolean that indicates if information about the individual steps are printed
while fitting the GLM. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
