\usage{
\method{residuals}{glmGamPoi}(
  object,
  Y,
  type = c("deviance", "pearson", "randomized_quantile", "working", "response"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fit of type \code{glmGamPoi}. It is usually produced with a call to
\code{glm_gp()}.}

\item{Y}{any matrix-like object (e.g. \code{matrix()}, \code{DelayedArray()}, \code{HDF5Matrix()}) with
one column per sample and row per gene.}

\item{type}{the type of residual that is calculated. See details for more information.
Default: \code{"deviance"}.}

\item{...}{currently ignored.}
}
\value{
a matrix with the same size as \code{Y}. If \code{Y} is a \code{DelayedArray} than the
result will be as well.

\description{
Extract Residuals of Gamma Poisson Model
}
\details{
This method can calculate a range of different residuals:
\describe{
\item{deviance}{The deviance for the Gamma-Poisson model is
\deqn{dev = 2 * (1/θ log((1 + µ θ) / (1 + y θ)) - y log((µ + y µ θ) / (y + y µ θ)))}
  and the residual accordingly is
\deqn{res = sign(y - µ) sqrt(dev).}
  }
\item{pearson}{The Pearson residual is \eqn{res = (y - µ) / sqrt(µ + µ^2 θ)}}
  \item{randomized_quantile}{The randomized quantile residual was originally developed
by Dunn & Smyth, 1995. Please see that publication or \code{\link[statmod:qresiduals]{statmod::qresiduals()}} for more
information.}
\item{working}{The working residuals are \eqn{res = (y - µ) / µ}.}
\item{response}{The response residuals are \eqn{res = y - µ}}
}
